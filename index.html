        An immense mausoleum of white marble, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by order of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favourite wife, the Taj Mahal is the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.

        Ellora Caves, Ellora also spelled Elura, a series of 34 magnificent rock-cut temples in northwest-central Maharashtra state, western India. They are located near the village of Ellora, 19 miles (30 km) northwest of Aurangabad and 50 miles (80 km) southwest of the Ajanta Caves. Spread over a distance of 1.2 miles (2 km), the temples were cut from basaltic cliffs and have elaborate facades and interior walls. The Ellora complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983.

        Angkor is one of the most important archaeological sites in South-East Asia. Stretching over some 400 km2, including forested area, Angkor Archaeological Park contains the magnificent remains of the different capitals of the Khmer Empire, from the 9th to the 15th century. They include the famous Temple of Angkor Wat and, at Angkor Thom, the Bayon Temple with its countless sculptural decorations. UNESCO has set up a wide-ranging programme to safeguard this symbolic site and its surroundings.

        <img src="https://monomousumi.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstockRF_1037036482.jpeg" height="200"> <br>
        A marvelous mystical icon ‘THE GREAT PYRAMID OF GIZA’ is a sight to behold. The Great Pyramid is a delight standing 455 feet tall on a rocky plateau on the west bank of River Nile. It stood high with pride as the tallest man-made structure for roughly 3800 years. One of the seven wonders of the ancient world and the only one left, the Great Pyramid is not only a monument but an actual puzzle to ponder. It is a gem of technical skill and engineering ability built approximately with 2.3 million blocks of limestone each weighing about 2 tonnes cut with precision.

        <h2>THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA</h2>
        <img src="https://d3hne3c382ip58.cloudfront.net/files/uploads/bookmundi/resized/cmsfeatured/visiting-the-great-wall-of-china-featured-image-1560845062-1000X561.jpg" height="200"> <br> 
        In c. 220 B.C., under Qin Shi Huang, sections of earlier fortifications were joined together to form a united defence system against invasions from the north. Construction continued up to the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), when the Great Wall became the world's largest military structure. Its historic and strategic importance is matched only by its architectural significance.
